# About Me
Originally from Grand Rapids, MI, I am also a fianc√©, a
father of one, a dog and cat owner, and currently located in Madison, WI as a
software engineering team lead working on clinical communications software for
healthcare. Outside of work, I'm busy parenting, dabbling in hobbyist software
development, playing Magic: The Gathering, or playing video games (likely a
Nintendo or fighting game). 

While I attended a traditional computer science program in university, I
actually taught myself to code when I was 12 years old, and my first programming
language was C#. In middle school, I made simple games using Windows Forms and
.NET WPF. In high school, I taught myself JavaScript and web development
technologies, such as Knockout, Angular.js, and .NET MVC. I also started and ran a
computer programming club in high school and taught other students basic web
development. (Fun fact: I also started and ran an eSports club too.)

In May 2020, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science with 
a minor in general business from Grand Valley State Univerity in Allendale, MI.
While in school, I was busy with full-time school and part-time work, and I even
had 3 part-time jobs at one point. I started out with retail, then transitioned
to IT, and then had three software development internships.

At BDO, I worked on internal .NET web apps for accountants. At Steelcase, I
worked on building monitoring tools for their industrial IoT division. At
Initech Global, I worked on building and maintained an internal ERP system.

Now at Epic, I'm currently a software developer team lead on Epic's Unified
Communications team, and I lead, design, and develop solutions for clinical
communications and alerting. On a unique team that does full-stack web and
native mobile development for iOS and Android, I'm a polyglot and use 8 different
programming languages regularly (C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Swift,
Objective-C, and M/MUMPS).

If you'd like to hear more about my experience or would simply like to connect,
please reach out via [email](mailto:joshjchua@protonmail.com) or LinkedIn. I'd like to start blogging about
computer programming and software development, so keep an eye out for that!
