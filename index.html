father of one, a dog and cat owner, and currently located in Madison, WI as a
software engineering team lead working on clinical communications software for
healthcare. Outside of work, I&rsquo;m busy parenting, dabbling in hobbyist software
development, playing Magic: The Gathering, or playing video games (likely a
Nintendo or fighting game).</p><p>While I attended a traditional computer science program in university, I
actually taught myself to code when I was 12 years old, and my first programming
language was C#. In middle school, I made simple games using Windows Forms and
.NET WPF. In high school, I taught myself JavaScript and web development
technologies, such as Knockout, Angular.js, and .NET MVC. I also started and ran a
computer programming club in high school and taught other students basic web
development. (Fun fact: I also started and ran an eSports club too.)</p><p>In May 2020, I graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in computer science with
a minor in general business from Grand Valley State Univerity in Allendale, MI.
While in school, I was busy with full-time school and part-time work, and I even
had 3 part-time jobs at one point. I started out with retail, then transitioned
to IT, and then had three software development internships.</p><p>At BDO, I worked on internal .NET web apps for accountants. At Steelcase, I
worked on building monitoring tools for their industrial IoT division. At
Initech Global, I worked on building and maintained an internal ERP system.</p><p>Now at Epic, I&rsquo;m currently a software developer team lead on Epic&rsquo;s Unified
Communications team, and I lead, design, and develop solutions for clinical
communications and alerting. On a unique team that does full-stack web and
native mobile development for iOS and Android, I&rsquo;m a polyglot and use 8 different
programming languages regularly (C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Swift,
Objective-C, and M/MUMPS).</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to hear more about my experience or would simply like to connect,
please reach out via <a href=mailto:joshjchua@protonmail.com>email</a> or LinkedIn. I&rsquo;d like to start blogging about
computer programming and software development, so keep an eye out for that!</p></article></div></main><footer class=siteFooter><div><a class=siteFooter__title href=/>Josh Chua</a><br><span class=siteFooter__copyright>Copyright &copy; 2023 Josh Chua | All rights reserved.</span></div><div><ul class=siteFooter__list><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joshchua/resume/blob/main/output/online/general/Josh%20Chua%20Resume%20(Limited%20Contact%20Info%20for%20Online).pdf>Resume</a></li><li><a href=/blog>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshjchua>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joshchua>GitHub</a></li></ul></div></footer></body></html>
