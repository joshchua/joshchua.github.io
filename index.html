Allendale, MI where I met my fianc√© in my freshman year. I am also a father of one,
have a dog and a cat, and currently reside in Madison, WI where I am a software
engineering team lead working on clinical communications software for healthcare
systems. Outside of work, I&rsquo;m busy parenting, dabbling in hobbyist software development,
playing Magic: The Gathering, or playing video games (likely a Nintendo or fighting game).</p><p>While I completed a traditional computer science program in university, I
actually taught myself to code when I was 12 years old with my first programming
language being C#. In middle school, I made simple games using Windows Forms and
.NET WPF. In high school, I taught myself JavaScript and web development
technologies, such as Knockout, Angular.js, and .NET MVC. I also started and ran a
computer programming club in high school and taught other students basic web
development. Fun fact: I also started and ran an eSports club too.</p><p>In May of 2020, I graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in computer science with
a minor in general business from Grand Valley State University.
While in school, I was busy with both full-time school and part-time work, and I even
had 3 concurrent part-time jobs in my junior year. I started out with a retail job,
then transitioned into IT support, and then ended my time at college with three different
software development internships.</p><p>My first internship was at BDO where I worked on internal .NET web apps for accountants.
Then, at Steelcase I worked on building monitoring tools for their industrial IoT division. Lastly, at Initech Global I worked on building and maintaining an internal ERP system.</p><p>Now at Epic, I&rsquo;m a software developer team lead on Epic&rsquo;s Unified Communications team where I lead, design, and develop solutions for clinical
communications and patient device alerting. I work on a unique team that does
full-stack web and native mobile development for iOS and Android.</p><p>If you would like to hear more about my experience or would simply like to connect,
please reach out via <a href=mailto:joshjchua@protonmail.com>email</a> or LinkedIn. I plan on starting a blog about computer programming and software development, so please keep an eye out for that!</p></article></div></main><footer class=siteFooter><div><a class=siteFooter__title href=/>Josh Chua</a><br><span class=siteFooter__copyright>Copyright &copy; 2023 Josh Chua | All rights reserved.</span></div><div><ul class=siteFooter__list><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joshchua/resume/blob/main/output/online/general/Josh%20Chua%20Resume%20(Limited%20Contact%20Info%20for%20Online).pdf>Resume</a></li><li><a href=/blog>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshjchua>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joshchua>GitHub</a></li></ul></div></footer></body></html>
